# Quest Board MVP Development Summary

## Project Overview

Quest Board is a gamified chore management system that transforms household
tasks into quests with bounties. The MVP focuses on core functionality while
establishing a solid foundation for future enhancements.

## MVP Scope & Timeline

**Total Duration:** 8 weeks
**Team Size:** 2-3 developers (1 backend, 1-2 frontend)

### Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|-------|------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Week 1 | Project Setup & Foundation | Development environment, database schema, basic auth |
| **Phase 2** | Week 2-3 | Backend API Development | Complete REST API, RBAC, background jobs |
| **Phase 3** | Week 4-6 | Frontend Development | React app, UI components, user experience |
| **Phase 4** | Week 7 | Integration & Testing | Full stack integration, comprehensive testing |
| **Phase 5** | Week 8 | Deployment & Documentation | Production deployment, user documentation |

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack

- **Framework:** Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database:** SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **ORM:** Prisma with migrations and type generation
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth2 + JWT
- **Testing:** Jest with supertest for API testing

### Frontend Stack

- **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Routing:** React Router v6
- **Testing:** Vitest

### Development Environment

- **Containerization:** Docker + Docker Compose
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Code Quality:** ESLint, Prettier, pre-commit hooks

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. User Authentication

- Google OAuth2 integration
- JWT token management
- Session handling

### 2. Quest Management

- Create, edit, delete quests (admin/editor)
- View quest board (all users)
- Claim quests (players)
- Complete quests (players)

### 3. Quest Lifecycle

- **Available** → **Claimed** → **Completed** → **Approved/Rejected**
- 48-hour claim expiry (automatic)
- Approval workflow (admin/editor)

### 4. Role-Based Access Control

- **Admin:** Full system access
- **Editor:** Quest management + approvals
- **Player:** Quest claiming + completion

### 5. User Dashboard

- Personal statistics
- Current quests overview
- Bounty balance

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

1. **Users** - User profiles and authentication
2. **Quests** - Quest definitions and status
3. **Approvals** - Quest completion approvals

### Key Relationships

- Users can create multiple quests
- Users can claim one quest at a time
- Quests have one approval record

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /auth/google` - Google OAuth2 login
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh JWT token
- `POST /auth/logout` - Logout

### Users

- `GET /users/me` - Current user profile
- `PUT /users/me` - Update profile
- `GET /users` - List users (admin)

### Quests

- `GET /quests` - List all quests
- `GET /quests/:id` - Quest details
- `POST /quests` - Create quest
- `PUT /quests/:id` - Update quest
- `DELETE /quests/:id` - Delete quest
- `POST /quests/:id/claim` - Claim quest
- `POST /quests/:id/complete` - Complete quest
- `POST /quests/:id/approve` - Approve completion
- `POST /quests/:id/reject` - Reject completion

### Dashboard

- `GET /dashboard` - User dashboard data
- `GET /dashboard/stats` - User statistics

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started

1. Run `./scripts/setup.sh` to initialize the project
2. Configure Google OAuth2 credentials
3. Set up environment variables
4. Run `./scripts/setup-db.sh` to set up the database
5. Run `./scripts/start-dev.sh` to start development

### Development Process

1. **Feature Development:** Create feature branches from main
2. **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests
3. **Code Review:** Submit pull requests for review
4. **Integration:** Merge to main after approval
5. **Deployment:** Automated deployment via CI/CD

### Quality Assurance

- **Code Quality:** ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode
- **Testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
- **Security:** Input validation, RBAC, secure authentication
- **Performance:** API response time < 500ms, page load < 3s

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks

1. **Google OAuth2 Complexity**
   - Start with simple OAuth flow
   - Incremental feature addition
   - Comprehensive testing

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - Use polling initially
   - Plan WebSocket implementation for v1.1

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **RBAC Implementation**
   - Thorough testing of role combinations
   - Clear permission documentation

2. **Background Job Reliability**
   - Implement retry logic
   - Add monitoring and alerting
